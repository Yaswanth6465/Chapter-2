    <div class="pageset">One of the most powerful features of the NetView program is the ability to run REXX code in the NetView environment. Many NetView components and base NetView functions exercise code that has been written in REXX. The NetView program also contains several parts that make use of the Data REXX function. Use the Data REXX function to include REXX instructions and functions in data files. To initialize the NetView program, you might need to adjust the maximum number of language processor environments defined by TSO that the system can initialize for the NetView address space. <br>

    <ol type="1">
        <li>The MVS IEFACTRT SMF installation exit receives control from the system when a job or job step ends, either normally or abnormally. The NetView program provides an IEFACTRT sample exit (CNMSMF3E) that passes data across the PPI to a receiver which issues a message that can be automated using the NetView automation facilities. If you plan to use the CNMSMF3E sample as an IEFACTRT exit routine, associate the CNMSMF3E sample to the IEFACTRT exit by adding the following statement to your PROGxx member:<br>
        <div class="bline">EXIT ADD EXITNAME(SYS.IEFACTRT) MODNAME(CNMSMF3E)</div>
            More than one exit routine can be defined for the IEFACTRT exit, so there might be more than one EXIT statement for the SYS.IEFACTRT exit in your PROGxx member.
        </li>  
        <li>You can use the Canzlog log to view the system log messages that were issued before the NetView subsystem was initialized. To enable these preinitialization messages to be written to the Canzlog log, add this statement to the PROGxx member
        <div class="bline">EXIT ADD EXITNAME(CNZ_MSGTOSYSLOG) MODNAME(DSI4LCUI)</div>
            The preinitialization messages are logged with an ASTYPE value of E.

             <ol type="1">
             <li>The name of the subsystem for the NetView program is 4 characters and must be the first 4 characters of the procedure names that you use to start the following address spaces:
             <ul>
                 <li>NetView subsystem (sample CNMSJ010)</li>
                 <li>NetView application (sample CNMSJ009)</li>
                 </ul>
                 For example, if both procedure names begin with CNMP, you can code the following entry in the IEFSSNxx member:
             <div class="bline">SUBSYS SUBNAME(CNMP) INITRTN(DSI4LSIT)</div>
                 Create one entry for each instance of the NetView program that you plan to start on this system. Make sure that you specify the INITRTN value (DSI4LSIT) for each entry.</li>
                 <li>Any subsystem name that you define for the NetView program can be used only for the NetView program. If you choose a subsystem name that was previously used, restart MVS before using the subsystem name. If the NetView program is started as a job rather than as a task, the job name must have the same first four characters as the subsystem interface and startup procedure.</li>
                 <li>Consider the following conditions before deciding where to place the NetView subsystem name in the IEFSSNxx member:</li>
                 <ul>
                 <li>If you place the NetView subsystem name after other subsystem names in the IEFSSNxx member, all MVS messages and commands received by the NetView subsystem are affected by the changes made by the other subsystems that are listed before the NetView subsystem.</li>
                 <li>If you are defining more than one NetView subsystem (SSI) in the IEFSSNxx member, the first NetView subsystem must come before the BEGINPARALLEL keyword. Any remaining NetView subsystems can be defined following the BEGINPARALLEL keyword. If you are defining only one NetView subsystem, the NetView subsystem can be placed before or after the BEGINPARALLEL keyword in the IEFSSNxx member.</li>
                 <li>By default, the NetView program does not send unsolicited foreign messages (those originating at another MVS LPAR in the same sysplex that are not specifically destined for an EMCS console owned by a NetView operator) to Canzlog. To have foreign messages eligible to be logged in Canzlog, specify the following parameter on the first SUBSYS statement that contains INITRTN(DSI4LSIT):</li></ul>
                 <div class="bline">INITPARM('LOGFORN')</div>
                 Note that the NetView subsystem initialization routine ignores any value specified on INITPARM on a SUBSYS statement containing INITRTN(DSI4LSIT) that is not the first such statement read by MVS.
                 <li>The DSI4LSIT initialization routine allocates the CNMCANZ0 data space where MVS and NetView messages are stored. The data space wraps when it reaches its current usable size. CNMCANZ0 is the main Canzlog data space, and by default is allocated with a static data space size of 2 GB. If the data space is specified as dynamic, it will allocate 128 MB of storage and grow by 8 MB as necessary accommodate message processing until it reaches its maximum size.<br>
                 To explicitly define the data space size to be a maximum of 2GB, specify the following value on the INITPARM parameter on the first SUBSYS statement that contains INITRTN(DSI4LSIT)
                 <div class="bline">INITPARM('FULLDS')</div><hr>
                 To restrict the data space size to a maximum of 512 MB, specify the following value on the INITPARM parameter on the first SUBSYS statement that contains INITRTN(DSI4LSIT):
                 <div class="bline">INITPARM('TINYDS')</div>
                 To explicitly define the data space size to be static, which means the entire data space storage will be used before wrapping occurs, specify the following value on the INITPARM parameter on the first SUBSYS statement that contains INITRTN(DSI4LSIT):
                <div class="bline">INITPARM('STATIC')</div> 
                 To explicitly define the data space size to be dynamic, which means only 128 MB of data space storage will be used before wrapping occurs, unless more space is needed to accommodate situations where logging of messages is much faster than automation of messages, specify the following value on the INITPARM parameter on the first SUBSYS statement that contains INITRTN(DSI4LSIT):
                 <div class="bline">INITPARM('DYNAMIC')</div>
                 Note that when DYNAMIC is used and Canzlog data is not being archived, the amount of messages that can be browsed is less than when the Canzlog data space is defined as STATIC.<br>
The NetView subsystem initialization routine ignores any value specified on the INITPARM parameter on a SUBSYS statement that contains INITRTN(DSI4LSIT) that is not the first such statement read by MVS.<br>
 Multiple values can be specified on the INITPARM parameter. For example, if the TINYDS, DYNAMIC, and LOGFORN values are required, specify these values on the same INITPARM parameter:
                     <div class="bline">INITPARM('TINYDS,DYNAMIC,LOGFORN')</div>
                     Separate the values with a comma.
</li>
 <li>If you do not add the NetView subsystem to the subsystem name table, you can dynamically add it before starting the NetView subsystem. For information on dynamically adding the subsystem name to the table, see “Starting the NetView Program Without Restarting the MVS System” on page 67.</li>

             The IEASYSxx member in the SYS1.PARMLIB data set contains system parameters.<br>
If you are using the status monitor, system automation, or Automatic Restart Manager (ARM) support, update the MAXUSER and RSVNONR values using the following steps:
                 <ul>
  <li>For the status monitor, determine the number of times you expect to stop and restart the NetView program over the life of the MVS IPL.</li>
  <li>For system automation, determine the number of times you expect to stop and restart the NetView subsystem interface (SSI) address space over the life of the MVS IPL.</li>
  <li>If both the preceding sets of conditions apply, add the values together that you computed.</li>
</ul>
Increase the number of address spaces available to MVS by this value by changing the MAXUSER or RSVNONR value, or both:<hr>
                 <ul>
  <li>Set MAXUSER to the number of ASIDs you want available at any one time.</li>
  <li>Set RSVNONR to the replacement values.</li>
</ul>
                 <b>Usage notes:</b>
<ol type="1">
    <li>The MVS program does not reuse any address space identifiers (ASIDs) that have established a program call interface. The NetView subsystem interface address space does reuse ASIDs that have established a program call interface. The RSVNONR value provides a way to specify replacement ASIDs for the ones lost.</li>
    <li>The total of the values of MAXUSER, RSVNONR, and RSVSTRT, cannot exceed 32767. If you want a low MAXUSER value, be sure to provide a reasonably large value for RSVNONR.</li>

       <div class="pageset">
        <b>Additional considerations:</b>
        </div> 
        <ol type="1">
        <li>1.You can use the &CNMDOMN variable to define the NetView domain to applications outside of the main NetView address space. If you use the A01APPLS (CNMS0013) sample, you can use the &CNMDOMN variable to provide the NetView domain to VTAM. If you do not set this variable, replace all occurrences of the &CNMDOMN variable in the A01APPLS sample with the NetView domain. Within the NetView address space, use the &DOMAIN local symbolic variable to specify the NetView domain.</li>
        <li>2.RODM looks for an optional EKGCUST DD statement in the jobstream. The EKGCUST statement names the input customization member. If you defined a customization member, RODM reads it. If not, RODM provides defaults. You can use symbols to represent operands, values, and comments on the EKGCUST statement, if symbolic substitution is enabled on your system. Ensure that these symbols are defined in the IEASYMxx member.</li>
         <li>3.The SNA topology manager is shipped with an initialization file (FLBSYSD). In addition, the FLBOSIDS, FLBSRT, and FLBEXV files can be used to further customize SNA topology manager views. If symbolic substitution is enabled on your system, you can use symbols in these initialization and customization files. Ensure that the symbols are defined in the IEASYMxx member.</li>

        <h4>IKJTSOxx</h4>
        <div class="pageset">
        The IKJTSOxx member contains TSO/E settings, including command and program authorization information.<br><br>
If you plan to use the NetView agent, add the KPDDSCO command in the authorized program (AUTHPGM) section:
        <div class="bline">
            AUTHPGM NAMES(KPDDSCO,pgm2,...)</div></div>
        <div class="pageset">IBM Tivoli Monitoring components require the KPDDSCO command to be authorized in the IKJTSOxx member for persistent data store processing.<br>

        <h3>COUPLExx</h3>
        <div class="pageset">The COUPLExx member contains cross-system coupling facility (XCF) parameters.
Add the following DATA statement to identify the automatic restart manager (ARM) couple data to XCF:<br>
        
        <div class="bline">
           DATA TYPE(ARM) PCOUPLE(primary-dsname) ACOUPLE(alternate-dsname)</div>
        Initialize the primary and alternate ARM couple data sets after you create them.

        <h3>SMFPRMxx</h3>
        <div class="pageset">
        To write the following records to the System Management Facility (SMF) log, ensure that member SMFPRMxx in the SYS1.PARMLIB data set is set up to collect type 37, type38, and type 39 SMF records accordingly:
        </div>
        <ul>
    <li><b>SMF record type 37:</b> hardware monitor records</li>
    <li><b>SMF record type 38:</b> authorization, task resource utilization, and command resource utilization records</li>
    <li><b>SMF record type 38:</b> session monitor records</li>
</ul>

        
        
        <div class="pageset">
        The SMF 38 subtype 4 record is written on an interval. Set the SMF interval value, and if desired, the SMF synchronization value.<br><br>
If you plan to use the CNMSMF3E sample as an IEFACTRT exit routine, verify that type 30 SMF records are set up to be collected and that the EXITS operand of the SYS specification includes the IEFACTRT exit.<br><br>
For example, the following statement causes SMF record types 0 through 255 to be collected and the IEFACTRT exit to be called:<br><br>
        <div class="bline">
        SYS(TYPE(0:255),EXITS(IEFU83,IEFU84,IEFU85,IEFACTRT,IEFUJV,IEFUSI, IEFUJP,IEFUSO,IEFUJI,IEFUTL,IEFU29,IEFUAV),NOINTERVAL,NODETAIL)</div>

        <div class="pageset">
        You can use the IEFUSI exit to limit the region size and region limit, and to limit the size of data spaces and hiperspaces for jobs started on an MVS system. If you have the IEFUSI exit on your system, modify it as needed to accommodate the region sizes for the various address spaces of the NetView program. See Table 3 on page 17 for a list of the data spaces that are created by NetView address spaces.<br><br>

        <div class="pageset">
        The NetView program uses extended multiple console support (EMCS) consoles for tasks that issue MVS system operator commands.<br><br>
        EMCS consoles are dynamically defined. Any console names that you specify in the CONSOLxx member are not available for use as EMCS console names. Therefore, if you specify any console names in CONSOLxx, make sure that they are different from console names that you plan to use within the NetView program. For information on how to construct console names for use within the NetView program, see <u>“Assigning Unique EMCS Console Names” on page 55.</u><br><br>
EMCS consoles can be assigned attributes. For more information about these attributes, see the <em>IBM Z NetView Security Reference.</em></div><br><br>

        <div class="pageset">
        If your business policy and schedule allow it, restart the MVS system now to activate the changes. When restarting the MVS system, use the CLPA option, which enables the NetView program to access the new LPALIB members from NETVIEW.V6R3M0.SCNMLPA1.<br><br>
If you cannot restart the MVS system at this time, you can manually activate the changes that are required to start the NetView program. For more information on manually activating the changes, see “Starting the NetView Program Without Restarting the MVS System” on page 67. Plan to restart the MVS system at a later time to activate all the changes that you made to the MVS system.<br><br>
<b>Important:</b> If you are implementing a user-defined RACF® resource class and a user-defined RACF router table for RODM, you must restart MVS.<br><br>
